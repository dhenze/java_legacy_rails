= JavaLegacyRails

When porting an application from a JEE/Hibernate project to Rails, some of the inner workings are different, such as the serialization.
To support the switch, I created this project to ease the transition.

Right now the provided tools and helpers are:
* EnumCode: to be used with Enum-serialized fields. They are basically like serialized Arrays, but for some reason are split by a commata and a space ", ". The EnumCoder reads these values and returns an array.
** Usage: serialize :legacy_data, JavaLegacyRails::EnumCoder.new
